Technology Stack

| Technology     | Purpose in the Project |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Django**     | Backend framework used to build APIs, manage models, and handle server logic |
| **MySQL**      | Relational database to store structured data such as users, properties, and bookings |
| **GraphQL**    | (Optional) API layer allowing flexible queries between client and server |

Database Design
 Key Entities and Fields

1. **Users**
   - `id` (PK)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`
   - `role` (guest or host)

2. **Properties**
   - `id` (PK)
   - `host_id` (FK to Users)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `location`

3. **Bookings**
   - `id` (PK)
   - `user_id` (FK to Users)
   - `property_id` (FK to Properties)
   - `check_in`
   - `check_out`

4. **Reviews**
   - `id` (PK)
   - `user_id` (FK to Users)
   - `property_id` (FK to Properties)
   - `rating`
   - `comment`

5. **Payments**
   - `id` (PK)
   - `booking_id` (FK to Bookings)
   - `amount`
   - `status`
   - `payment_method`

### Relationships

- One **user** can have many **properties**.
- One **user** can make many **bookings**.
- Each **booking** is linked to one **property** and one **user**.
- Each **review** belongs to one user and one property.
- Each **payment** is linked to one booking.

Feature Breakdown

1. **User Authentication**
   - Handles user registration, login, and token-based authentication.

2. **Property Management**
   - Allows hosts to list, update, or remove properties.

3. **Booking System**
   - Enables guests to book properties and check availability.

4. **Payment Integration**
   - Secure processing of payments using third-party services (e.g., Stripe or Paystack).

5. **Review System**
   - Lets users review properties after staying.

6. **Admin Panel**
   - For internal management of listings, users, and complaints.

These features help simulate a fully functional booking platform with real-world workflows.

API Security
 Key Security Measures:

1. **Authentication**
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Token) or session-based authentication to validate users.

2. **Authorization**
   - Limit access to protected routes (e.g., only hosts can add listings).

3. **Input Validation**
   - Sanitize and validate incoming data to prevent SQL injection and XSS.

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent brute-force and DDoS attacks by limiting requests per IP.

5. **HTTPS**
   - Enforce secure communication between client and server.

### Why Security Matters
- Protects sensitive user information (like passwords and credit card data).
- Prevents abuse of the booking platform.
- Ensures trust between users and the system.

CI/CD Pipeline

 What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the process of:
- Running tests
- Linting code
- Building Docker images
- Deploying to production or staging environments

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: For workflow automation and testing on each push
- **Docker**: For building containers and deploying consistent environments
- **Heroku / Railway / Render** (Optional): Platforms for easy deployment

### Benefits:
- Faster feedback loops
- Reduced bugs in production
- Safer, consistent deployments


Airbnb Clone Project - Frontend

Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The frontend scope covers building a responsive and user-friendly interface to allow users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings.

##  Project Goals
- Implement clean, responsive UI/UX designs
- Structure a scalable and maintainable frontend architecture
- Practice teamwork and defined frontend roles
- Apply best practices in modern frontend development

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Design**: Figma
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

UI/UX Design Planning

###  Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Ensure consistent visual design
- Prioritize fast loading time
- Focus on responsive and mobile-first design

###  Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property information view
- Secure checkout process
- User login and signup flow

###  Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with search filters |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Full property info, image gallery, host details, and booking options |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Payment form, confirmation screen |

###  Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A seamless user experience improves trust and engagement. Clear navigation, responsive layout, and intuitive design reduce booking friction and increase user satisfaction.

Color Styles

- **Primary Color**: `#FF5A5F`
- **Secondary Color**: `#008489`
- **Background Color**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Text Color**: `#222222`
- **Secondary Text Color**: `#717171`

###  Typography

- **Primary Font**: Circular
  - **Body Text**: Medium (500), 16px
  - **Headings**: Bold (700), 24px–32px
  - **Secondary Text**: Book (400), 14px

###  Why Design Properties Matter
Understanding the visual identity of a mockup ensures consistency in font use, spacing, and layout. Developers can translate designs accurately from Figma into real code, maintaining brand alignment and UI integrity.
