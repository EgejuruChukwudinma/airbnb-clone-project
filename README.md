This project is a full-stack simulation of Airbnb’s core booking platform. The backend focuses on building robust APIs, managing a relational database, and implementing secure user and booking management workflows.

Project Goals
- Simulate a real-world backend development process
- Learn database design and backend architecture
- Build secure REST APIs and implement authentication
- Practice using CI/CD and deployment tools

Tech Stack
- Django (Backend Web Framework)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
- GraphQL (Optional API Layer)
- Git & GitHub
- Docker (Containerization)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
